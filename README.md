# React Portfolio

## Description

This project is a single-page React application that serves as my web developer portfolio. It allows users, including potential employers, to view my work samples, learn more about me, and get in touch with me. The motivation behind this project is to showcase my skills and experience as a web developer, making it easier for employers to assess my qualifications for open positions.

### Why I Built This Project

I built this project to create a modern and visually appealing portfolio using the latest technologies, specifically React. It allows me to stand out among other developers whose portfolios may not utilize these technologies. This portfolio serves as a central hub to display my projects, share my bio, and provide easy access to my contact information and resume.

### Problem It Solves

This portfolio solves the problem of efficiently presenting my work and qualifications to potential employers and collaborators. It provides a user-friendly interface that showcases my projects, bio, and contact details. The navigation and layout are designed to make it easy for users to explore different sections of the portfolio.

### What I Learned

During the development of this portfolio, I learned how to create a single-page React application with components such as Header, Navigation, Project, and Footer. I also gained experience in routing using `react-router-dom` to navigate between different sections of the portfolio. Additionally, I improved my design skills by choosing a unique color palette and ensuring a clean and polished user interface.
